### Project Overview

 We are working in the online retail company as data scientist. So we have been provided invoice data of the customer. Our aim is to check out the customers behavior based on the CutomerId,InvoiceNo,Quantity,UnitPriceand Countryetc. This is an unsupervised leaning project.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, we will have a better understanding of how to build a clustering model. In this project, we will apply the following concepts.

- Data preprocessing
- Data Visualisation
- k means clustering


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 For the customer segmentation, we first formed the customer-level data. After that, we did some feature engineering to form new features like frequency and monetary value of each customer and after finding the optimal cluster numbers using elbow method finally we apply the k-mean clustering method to predict the clusters.
